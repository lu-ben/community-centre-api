## Description & Technologies Used
This project is a virtual community center website that allows users to sign up for activities and also see/update others on local news. There are two different types of accounts - clients and employees, both of which have their own set of permissions across the application. Clients can sign up for upcoming activities, rent equipment, read/add messages in the bulletin board, and read announcements about the facilities and events. Employees can see stats of clients (ex. number of clients signed up for some activity), approve/delete bulletin posts, create announcements, and edit users' properties.

The front-end application is created with React JS/TS, Tailwind CSS is also used for the styling of the components.\
The back-end application is created with Express and NodeJS to query the local PostgreSQL database instance created in Docker.
